# Cristian nieto portfolio v1
## About

What I am looking for on this project is showing up what the development software trip has brought to me. It has been a long trip.

Showing up this portfolio is a big step in my life as a developer since It has been long time introducing new libraries new acknowledge to my personal skills but had never found the time to build it.  


## Technical develop
### Methodology

I use these projects to improve some lack of development skills that I must improve. That is why I followed the next steps each one to learn/improve some front-end skills.

### Figma 

I wanted to design my v1 portfolio site from scratch before coding anything. I had never used Figma I watched some Figma youtube videos specially from [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) Designing a initial style guide and Figma components is how the work must be done those were the resources and tutorials that I followed. Take a look to the [result](https://www.figma.com/file/1hYDcbFc012YUmvs6jNCHN/CrisDev-Portfolio?type=design&node-id=25%3A159&mode=design&t=JpFk1QNS8IBYo495-1).

As I mentioned prior the Figma design follows.

- Initial style guide
- Dark and light design
- Create reusable figma components
- Design for different screen sizes.


### CSS

It is always good improve skills that are not frequently used (Lately working mainly back-end).

### React

I want to follow the React philosophy creating reusable and responsive components that are used along the project. 


## Inspiration

The pandemic brought changes to many people's life I was no exception. I started working remotely with USA clients and I realized what good developers around world were doing. One of those good things are that they have their own portfolio. I wanted to have my own.
