This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

V1 of Cristian Nieto's portfolio. It has been a long trip to be here. What I am looking for on this project is showing up what this development trip has brought to me. 

## What was the methodology used to build this portfolio

what I usually do is using these projects to improve in some lack development skills that I must improve. That is why I followed next steps each one to learn/improve some front-end skills.

### Figma 

I wanted to design my v1 portfolio site from scratch before coding anything. I had never used Figma I watched some Figma youtube videos specially from [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) Designing a initial style guide and Figma components is how the work must be done those were the resources and tutorials that I followed. Take a look to the [result](https://www.figma.com/file/1hYDcbFc012YUmvs6jNCHN/CrisDev-Portfolio?type=design&node-id=25%3A159&mode=design&t=JpFk1QNS8IBYo495-1).

As I mentioned above the Figma design follows.

- Initial style guide
- Dark and light design
- Create reusable figma components
- Create design for different screen sizes.


### CSS

It is always good improve skills that are not frequently used (Lately working mainly back-end).

### React

I want to follow the React philosophy creating reusable and responsive components that are used along the project. 


## Inspiration

The pandemic brought changes to many people's life I was no exception. I started working remotely with USA clients and I realized what good around world's developers were doing. One of those good things are that they have their own portfolio. I had to had my own. 


## Front-end stuff

That is why showing up this portfolio is a big step in my life as a developer since It has been long time introducing new libraries new acknowledge to my personal skills but had never found the time to build this.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
